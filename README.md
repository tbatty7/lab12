This web app pulls data from the Reddit API and uses ng-repeat to make a list of pictures and titles.  
You can then select the checkbox and click on the link to the Favorites view and it will only show your 
favorites.

To run, you must have Node installed.  You also need to install http-server.  Once you have node installed, you can install http-server 
by typing this in your bash console `npm install http-server -g`.
Once installed, navigate to the lab12 folder and type `http-server -c-1` to start server.  
Then, in the browser go to `localhost:8080`
